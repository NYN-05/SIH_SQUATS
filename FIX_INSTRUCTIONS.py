Quick Fix Guide for Camera Issues
==================================

The camera was configured to use index 1, but your default camera is at index 0.

WHAT I FIXED:
1. ✅ Changed .env file: CAMERA_INDEX from 1 to 0
2. ✅ Added better camera initialization logging
3. ✅ Added camera status indicator updates
4. ✅ Fixed JavaScript errors from previous issues

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
====================

RESTART THE FLASK SERVER to apply the new camera index setting.

Follow these steps:

1. Stop the current server:
   - Find the terminal where Flask is running
   - Press Ctrl+C to stop it

2. Start the server again:
   - Run: python app.py
   
   OR in VS Code, run this command:
   ```
   cd "c:\Users\JHASHANK\Desktop\SIH 2025\SIH_SQUATS"
   python app.py
   ```

3. Refresh your browser (F5 or Ctrl+R)

The camera should now work properly!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

If the camera still doesn't work after restarting:

1. Test the camera:
   ```
   python test_camera.py
   ```

2. Check which camera works for you (0 or 1) and update .env accordingly

3. Make sure no other application is using the camera

4. Check the Flask console output for error messages
